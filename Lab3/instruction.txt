Hello good morning. Sorry because I forgot to send your activity yesterday. Your activity for this week is:

FRONTEND

Create a component with the ability to add, edit, display, and delete data. 

Inside the component, create a form with the following fields and send the data to the backend:

firstName
lastName
groupName
role
expectedSalary
expectedDateOfDefense


BACKEND

Create a router file that handles the operations of your data

GET - returns all data
POST - creates new data
PUT - update a specific data
DELETE - deletes a specific data


It's up to you how you would tackle this. The goal is to show me if you know how to do basic CRUD operations. ðŸ™‚
